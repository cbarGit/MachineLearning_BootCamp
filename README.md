Machine Learning Boot Camp
==============================

####This was created with the intent to learn and test the machine/deep learning algorithms.

The code used is `Python`, with the support of the classic libraries for scientific data analysis as:

- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Sklearn

The target is to cover both **supervised and unsupervised learning**.

>The repo will be expanded with more code and folders.
